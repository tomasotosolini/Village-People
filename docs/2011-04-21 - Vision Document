                           =====================


1. High level project goals/use cases
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 

The system will simulate the life of a town. It will simulate the People living
in the town and the Services they interact with in everyday life. The core
services will be: 

  - People Id Registry (PIR)
  - Hospital (H)
  - Bank (B)
  - People's Life Course Simulation

The system will simulate the time passing by.

System core use cases:

- Time passing
Actors: Time, time affected entity.
Time will tick and every affected entity is informed about the current simulated
universal time.

- Resources
Actors: Resource, consumer
The consumer asks for a specific amount form the resource, the resource is
consumed. 


2. High level architecture
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = 

Service oriented architecture. The components must be organized into independent
modules. It is foreseen that the client access is multi-protocol. Also the
services will be able to exchange message in a client-server mode.


3. Project risks overview
= = = = = = = = = = = = = 

Divert the development focus from developing a simulation to develop the
simulated entity.
