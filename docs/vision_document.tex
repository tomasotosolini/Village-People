\subsection{High level project goals} 
The system will simulate life in a town. It will simulate people living in a town and services they interact with in everyday life. 

\subsection{Core services} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item People Id Registry (PIR)
\item Hospital (H)
\item Bank (B)
\item People's Life Course Simulation
\end{enumerate}
The system will simulate time passing by.

\subsection{System core use cases}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Time passing}  
	
	- Actors: Time, time affected entity

	- Time will tick and every affected entity is informed about the current simulated universal time

  \item \textbf{Resources}

	- Actors: Resource, Consumer

	- The consumer asks for a specific amount form the resource, the resource is consumed

  \item \textbf{People Life} 

	- Actors: Simulation, Person, Time

	- Simulation creates Person then Person lives and after some time the Simulation destroys the Person

  \item \textbf{People Id Registry (PIR) Enquiry}

	- Actors: People Id Registry, other System's Entity

	- A System's Entity enquiries the PIR to obtain information about some other System's Entity. The PIR will then supply the requested information  if available

  \item \textbf{People Id Registry (PIR) Birth Registration}

	- Actors: People Id Registry, Simulation, Person

	- Once the Simulation creates a new Person, it also asks to PIR to register the birth event

  \item \textbf{People Id Registry (PIR) Death Registration}

	- Actors: People Id Registry, Simulation, Person

	- Once the Simulation destroy a new Person, it also asks to PIR to register the death event

  \item \textbf{Hospital (H) Request}

	- Actors: Person, Hospital

	- A Person goes to the Hospital, and after some time exits in three possible states: healed, not healed, death

  \item \textbf{Bank (B) Fund Request}

	- Actors: Person, Bank

	- A Person goes to the Bank and obtains some fund

  \item \textbf{Bank (B) Fund Depot}

	- Actors: Person, Bank

	- A Person goes to the Bank and depots some fund
\end{itemize}


\subsection{High level architecture}
Service oriented architecture. The components must be organized into independent
modules. It is foreseen that the client access is multi-protocol. Also the
services will be able to exchange message in a client-server mode.

It appears reasonable to choose a component based development model because
of the intended modular structure of the software parts involved in to system.
Moreover the component modelling encourages the separation of the various parts
of the structure and leads to a service oriented design, potentially remote
services.

\subsection{Project risks overview}
Divert the development focus from developing a simulation to develop the
simulated entity.
