\subsection{Time Resource (TCR)} 
The resource architecture is the implemented using the observer pattern.

TCR is the \textbf{Subject} process. At regular time intervals each time affected entity (\textbf{Observers}) is notified abuot current time by means of a dedicated messge.

To support this feature time affected entities must implement the interface TimeAffected\footnote{
In a more refined implementation this method will become asynchronous..<<.
} described hereafter

\begin{verbatim}
interface TimeAffected_Observer {

   public void sync(Time: Date);

}
\end{verbatim}

To be informed about time passing by, TAE will register/unregister themselves by TCR using the following interface:

\begin{verbatim}
interface TimeResource {

   public register(TimeAffected tae) /*throws TimeResourceException*/;
   public unegister(TimeAffected tae) /*throws TimeResourceException*/;
   public void notify();

}
\end{verbatim}

Once registered by TCR, TAE will immediately starts being fed with periodic time passing messages (sync).

To allow variable time simulation speed TCR implements
